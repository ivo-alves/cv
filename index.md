### Professional Experience ###

* __Senior Software Developer @ Nukklear__ - Ported Super Meat Boy Forever to Android and iOS. Since the game has an in-house engine we had to resort to OpenGLES 3.0 and c++. An intensive work in performance optimization was made to ensure 60fps on the mobile platform.
Worked with Unreal 4 (c++) and Hadean’s Aether Engine (pure c), a spatial solution for large world simulations. Here we created a city emergency scenario that was processed by multiple offsite servers.
* __Software developer @ Miniclip SA__ - Responsible for supporting and improving the internal codebase libraries. Worked with cocos-2d and obj-c for the mobile titles. Implemented unity package tools to be used internally.
* __Software developer @ Indot Studio__ - Created game prototypes and editor tools using Unity.

### Academic Progress ###

* __Digital Game Development Engineering__ - Instituto Politécnico do Cávado e do Ave (Barcelos, Portugal)
* __Bachelor of Design and Multimedia__ - Universidade de Coimbra (Coimbra, Portugal) (first year only)

## Keep The Keep ##

### Update ###
26th jan 2020 - Keep the keep just got released:

[Download on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tuskgames.KeepTheKeep)

[Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1543935852)

Keep the keep is the longest project I've been working on. Initially created and designed by Marco Vale, it has become a team effort and we're both investing all of our free time so we can share it with the world.

## Unit's DOTs experiment ##

Just a simple gravity system to explore unit's DOTs.

This simulation is running on a i5 Mac mini (Late 2014).

## Archery Prototype ##

This prototype is an action multiplayer game for mobile. Here i've experimented with some game mechanics, camera behaviours, user-input and tested the draw backs of having network latency in a fast paced game.

# Academic Projects #

<br/>

## Geoclipmap Terrain ##

Experiment project using __c++__ and __GLSL__ to play with shaders. Created a geoclipmap terrain based on this [paper](http://hhoppe.com/gpugcm.pdf).

This implementation can draw a terrain (or water) with different levels of detail depending on the distance without artefacts popping out as the detail gets closer.

The terrain and water meshes are static and only generated during the start up. The height of the mesh is computed with GPU. This reduces cpu process time and has very low cost on performance.

## Platformer ##

Project developed using __MonoGame__ to test some game mechanics. Since MonoGame has no built-in editor, I used blender to define the level data and properties for dynamic objects.
This allowed me to create levels with different game mechanics such as:
- Ghost Character - A second character that moved using the same use input as the main character but interacted with different objects (ghost objects)
- Linked Character - This would link 2 characters together in order to be able to reach places that the player otherwise would reach
- Slow Motion - Only the character motion would be affected, allowing the player to make skilled jumps that otherwise would be too difficult.

## My First Game On The Play Store ##

Before staring my professional career I wanted to make sure I had at least one project in the play store, hoping that it would make me more experienced and help me stand out amongst other candidates.
So I made this casual game named Ninja Rise. It didn't end up a very polished game but I'm still proud of what I've achieved.

# Hobbies #

I've been doing 3d modeling and rendering since i was about 15 years old, it is one of my favorite hobbies. From time to time I also do some digital painting. You can check out more on [my deviantart](https://ivomiguel.deviantart.com)
